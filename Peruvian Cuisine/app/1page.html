    <dfn><h3>Flag Information</h3> </dfn>
    <p><img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/f6991e55-417a-42c6-86be-529ff18464ac%2Fpe-flag.webp?v=1633225779274" alt="Flag" height="280" class="flowLeft">The first national flag of Peru was created in 1820, when José de San Martín arrived with his Army of the Andes from Argentina and Chile. The Peruvian flag he designed combined the colours red and white, said to have been chosen because San Martín saw a flock of flamingos take wing at his arrival. The form of the flag was unusual—a diagonal division forming two white and two red triangles with a coat of arms in the centre. When local independence partisans established themselves, another flag was adopted on March 15, 1822. The resemblance of this flag (equal red-white-red horizontal stripes with a red sun, the traditional emblem of the Inca empire, in the centre) to that of Spain caused confusion, and it was soon altered (May 31) to a flag with vertical stripes, but the sun emblem remained in the center.

On February 25, 1825, the design now in use was established. The red-white-red vertical stripes from the previous flag were retained, but the sun was replaced by a new coat of arms. Its shield is framed by one wreath (of palm and laurel branches) and surmounted by another. The shield is divided into three parts with figures symbolic of national pride and wealth. The vicuña, a free-roaming camelid closely related to the llama and alpaca, is represented in the first quartering; in addition to representing the riches of Peruvian fauna, it stands for freedom, national pride, and heroism. The second quartering has a cinchona tree, the bark of which is used to make quinine. Finally, the bottom half of the shield displays a cornucopia from which spill gold and silver coins, symbolic of the nation’s mineral wealth. In addition, the white stripe of the flag is said to represent purity, and the red recalls the blood of patriots. As in a number of other countries, the civil flag flown by private citizens displays only the stripes, the coat of arms being reserved for flags serving official (i.e., government) purposes.</p><br>

Its rich history and travel opportunities abound are staged amid the country’s wonderful landscapes. A Peru map is filled with majestic Andes Mountains, the mysterious Amazon jungle, and coastal desert.Peru is located south of the equator in the western part of South America. Slightly smaller than Alaska, Peru shares borders with five neighboring countries: Ecuador and Colombia to the north, Brazil to the east, Bolivia to the southeast, and Chile to the south. The country’s boundary to the west is the Pacific Ocean.
  <u><b>3 Natural Zones in Peru </b></u>
      <br><b>The Coast of Peru: </b></br>The coastal region, where the capital of Lima is located, is a narrow coastal plain crossed by mostly desert and fertile valleys. Here, there are agricultural plantations of cotton, sugar and rice, as well as most of the country’s oil fields.
  <br><b>The Highlands of Peru:</b></br></html> The Sierra, part of the Andes Mountains, has soaring peaks – some above 19,770 feet (6,000 meters). In this area are the country’s mineral resources: silver, zinc, lead, copper and gold, and most of its livestock. La Selva is very fertile, subtropical subclimate of the highland region.
<br><b>The Jungle of Peru:</b></br> The Amazon rainforest occupies the eastern part of Peru and is filled with an immense amount of natural resources. Unfortunately, the lack of communication and transportation infrastructure makes remote regions of virgin jungle susceptible to the illegal exploitation of lumber and high value minerals such as gold.
Ecotourism in the Amazon aims to educate the world about the importance of the jungle and raise attention to what threatens its existence. The population of Peru is a mixture of Indians, mestizos, descendants of Spanish colonists, in addition, there are Chinese communities of African origin.</p>

  <dfn><h3>Machu Picchu </h3> </dfn>
   <p>Machu Picchu, also spelled Machupijchu, site of ancient Inca ruins located about 50 miles (80 km) northwest of Cuzco, Peru, in the Cordillera de Vilcabamba of the Andes Mountains. It is perched above the Urubamba River valley in a narrow saddle between two sharp peaks—Machu Picchu (“Old Peak”) and Huayna Picchu (“New Peak”)—at an elevation of 7,710 feet (2,350 metres). One of the few major pre-Columbian ruins found nearly intact, Machu Picchu was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1983.Although the site escaped detection by the Spaniards, it may have been visited by the German adventurer Augusto Berns in 1867. However, Machu Picchu’s existence was not widely known in the West until it was “discovered” in 1911 by the Yale University professor Hiram Bingham, who was led to the site by Melchor Arteaga, a local Quechua-speaking resident. Bingham had been seeking Vilcabamba (Vilcapampa), the “lost city of the Incas,” from which the last Inca rulers led a rebellion against Spanish rule until 1572. He cited evidence from his 1912 excavations at Machu Picchu, which were sponsored by Yale University and the National Geographic Society, in his labeling of the site as Vilcabamba; however, that interpretation is no longer widely accepted. (Nevertheless, many sources still follow Bingham’s precedent and erroneously label Machu Picchu as the “lost city of the Incas.”) Evidence later associated Vilcabamba with another ruin, Espíritu Pampa, which was also discovered by Bingham. In 1964 Espíritu Pampa was extensively excavated under the direction of the American explorer Gene Savoy. The site was much deteriorated and overgrown with forest, but Savoy uncovered remains there of some 300 Inca houses and 50 or more other buildings, as well as extensive terraces, proving that Espíritu Pampa was a much larger settlement.Machu Picchu was further excavated in 1915 by Bingham, in 1934 by the Peruvian archaeologist Luis E. Valcarcel, and in 1940–41 by Paul Fejos. Additional discoveries throughout the Cordillera de Vilcabamba have shown that Machu Picchu was one of a series of pucaras (fortified sites), tambos (travelers’ barracks, or inns), and signal towers along the extensive Inca foot highway.
