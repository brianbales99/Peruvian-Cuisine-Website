   <dt><u><b>Pisco Sour</b></u></dt>
   <dd>The Pisco Sour is considered the national drink of Peru and it even has its own National Holiday. National Pisco Sour Day is celebrated on the first Saturday in February.

Pisco Sour is made of Peruvian Pisco as the base liquor with lime juice, syrup, ice, egg white, and Angostura bitters. 

The Pisco Sour is a refreshing and tasty Peruvian drink. It can be deceptively strong though the citrus flavors make it very easy to drink. 

This is one of the drinks of Peru you absolutely cannot miss. </dd>

  <dt><u><b>Chicha Morada – Purple Corn Drink</b></u></dt>
   <dd>Chicha Morada is another traditional Peruvian drink made from purple corn. Purple corn or Maiz Morada, in Spanish, is one of the unique corn varieties native to Peru.

This corn variety has a long history and is said to date back prior to the creation of the Inca Empire. 

Besides the unique color, Purple corn has many health benefits such as fighting diabetes, obesity, cancer and more. 

This Peruvian drink is non alcoholic and is made by boiling purple corn with pineapple skin, cinnamon, cloves, and sugar. 

This was one of our favorite traditional Peruvian drinks. We always enjoyed having it with our meals. Sweet and deliciously refreshing, the hint of cinnamon adds a bright spark to the tongue. 

With its intriguing deep purple color, we could not resist all the goodness contained up in this unique drink in Peru. </dd>

       <dt><u><b>Inca Kola</b></u></dt>
   <dd>In countries like the U.S. it’s either Coca Cola or Pepsi. In Peru, there’s only one soft drink of choice – Inca Kola. 

Inca Kola is a yellow fluorescent colored soda that is super sweet and tastes like bubblegum. 

The origins of Inca Kola go back to 1910 where a young English couple José Robinson Lindley and his wife Martha opened a small shop in Lima, where they sold homemade carbonated beverages. 

In 1935 Lima was celebrating 400 year since its founding and the Lindleys decided to produce a unique drink to commemorate the event and their new homeland. Marketed as the “Pride of Peru” you’ll see this drink everywhere. 

Extremely popular throughout the country, this is prefered drink to complement Peruvian cuisine.  

Today, the Inca Kola Trademark is owned by Coca-Cola. You can find Inca Kola at Peruvian restaurants in the U.S. or at international sections of grocery stores.

     <dt><u><b>Cusquena Beer</b></u></dt>     
   <dd>Although Pisco Sour is the most well-known drink in Peru, Peruvian beers are also popular.

Peru has three major beer brands Pilsen Callao, Cristal and Cusqueña. Pilsen Callao and Cristal are both lagers with little flavor in Claire’s opinion (yes I am not a beer drinker). 

Cusquena beer makes several kinds of beers. You’ll find Golden Lager, Red Lager, Wheat beer, and Dark Lager. There is a beer for every taste.

The Cusquena beer was by far Claire’s favorite. She enjoyed the range of flavors and smooth tastes.

 Other regional beers that are not widely available are the Arequipeña from Arequipa and Pilsen Trujillo from Trujillo.

Craft or artisanal beers, known as “cerveza artesanal” have been gaining popularity especially in Lima and Cusco. 

Local brewers are experimenting with unique flavors like quinoa beer which blend history and modernity.</dd>
